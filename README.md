# RollABall-Scripts
Scripts for my first completed solo project. These are available for portfolio and educational purposes.

# Development Timeline
May 2024 - June 2024

# About the Project
Roll-A-Ball is a mini-game where the player can select one of four difficulties: easy, medium, hard, and insane. The goal of the game is for the
player to roll a ball across a randomly generated path above an endless pit and not fall down into it. The higher the difficulty, the longer the
path is (also, in insane difficulty it's pitch black except for a small spotlight around the ball, making it harder to see the path ahead). As for
the camera and movement, the player can use WASD or arrow keys on the keyboard to move, while the camera is static and stays behind the player at an
angle.

# Development Reflection
Roll-A-Ball was my first fully completed and functional project, and it helped a lot with my confidence as a new developer. Even though the
scope was very small, this project helped me understand the lifecycle of game creation (and some aspects about software development as a 
whole). Completing Roll-A-Ball showed me that I could finish a project from start to end, and once I finished I went back to my very first
project (Crazy Runner, the infinite 3D runner but I was not able to complete it due to my lack of experience) and was able to complete Crazy
Runner after completing Roll-A-Ball.

While I used free assets for this project, I focused entirely on programming fundamentals (movement, collisions, game states, code structure, etc.),
and this experience gave me a solid foundation that I continued to build on in later projects (both finished and unfinished).
